an array would have to know the list to construct: 
Push - Reference, adding a value to a structure that has enough room
Emplace - constructing, constructing a structure with more room to fit the value 
push - conceptually - means to add onto the end 
In terms of conceptually - difference between a deque and a list, a deque will have some type of order, where lists order does not matter
